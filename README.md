<span style="color:#1e81b0"># Chess X-Press</span>

Creating chess for my coursework at Nottingham Trent University, using C++, SDL2 and SDL2_Mixer.

This was a pretty challenging project and I had tons of fun working on it. My submission date was 17/04/2023,
but I will be adding more and more features as I do want to make Chess X-Press the best chess engine it can be :D 
(with my abilities haha

This is my first full on application project; expect many more in the future (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
